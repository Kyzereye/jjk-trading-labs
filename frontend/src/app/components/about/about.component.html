          <h3>Catching Uptrends</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary objective is to identify and profit from sustained uptrends in stock prices. We use a simple yet 
            effective moving average crossover system to capture these trends:

                <strong>Entry Signal:</strong> We enter a position when the stock price closes above the 50-period moving average, 
                indicating the beginning of an uptrend.

              <div>
                <strong>Exit Signal:</strong> We exit when the price closes below the 21-period moving average, suggesting 
                the trend may be weakening.

                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> We use Average True Range (ATR) to set dynamic stop losses and trailing stops, 
                protecting profits while allowing trends to develop.

          <h3>The Legend of Richard Dennis</h3>
          <p>
            In the 1980s, legendary trader Richard Dennis proved that trading could be taught by training a group of novices—dubbed 
            the "Turtle Traders"—who went on to earn hundreds of millions using his systematic approach.

            <h4>Key Turtle Trading Principles We Apply:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Position Sizing:</strong> Risk only a small percentage of capital per trade (typically 1-5%), ensuring 
                no single trade can devastate the account.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Systematic Entry:</strong> Enter trades based on clear, objective signals—not emotions or hunches.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Let Winners Run:</strong> Use trailing stops to stay in profitable trades as long as the trend continues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cut Losses Quickly:</strong> Exit losing trades promptly using predetermined stop losses based on market volatility (ATR).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consistency:</strong> Follow the system religiously, removing emotional decision-making from trading.

          <h3>Understanding Smart Money</h3>
          <p>
            The Wyckoff Method, developed by Richard Wyckoff in the early 20th century, teaches us to read the market through 
            the lens of supply and demand, revealing how institutional "smart money" accumulates and distributes positions.

            By understanding Wyckoff's market phases, we recognize that uptrends (Markup phase) represent the optimal time 
            to be long in the market. Our system is specifically designed to capture these profitable phases while avoiding 
            the distribution and markdown phases where most retail traders lose money.

              How does the backtesting work?
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Our backtesting engine simulates trades using historical data, applying our moving average strategy with your 
            specified parameters. It calculates realistic entry and exit prices (using next-day open prices), applies position 
            sizing rules, and tracks performance metrics including total return, win rate, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

              What is ATR and why do we use it?
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility. We use ATR to set dynamic stop losses that adapt to each 
            stock's volatility—tighter stops for calm markets, wider stops for volatile markets. This prevents getting stopped 
            out by normal price fluctuations while still protecting capital.

              Can I customize the trading parameters?
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Yes! You can adjust all parameters including the analysis period, ATR multiplier, position sizing percentage, 
            and moving average type (EMA vs SMA). Visit your Profile & Settings to set default preferences, or adjust them 
            for each individual analysis.

              What's the difference between EMA and SMA?
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Simple Moving Average (SMA) gives equal weight to all prices in the period. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 
            gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new price action. EMA is generally preferred 
            for trend-following as it reacts faster to trend changes.

              How should I interpret the results?
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Focus on multiple metrics together: A good strategy typically has a win rate above 40%, positive Sharpe ratio 
            (above 1.0 is good), reasonable drawdown (under 20%), and consistent profitability. No single metric tells the 
            whole story—look at the complete picture including the equity curve and individual trades.
